### :wave: Hello fellow Homo Sapiens :walking:

I'm Tim and I'm creating [_Poly_](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly). The world's greatest library and command line utility for engineering organisms. Check it out and [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/TimothyStiles).

I'm looking for the best software developers to work on some of the most interesting and meaningful computational problems in biotech :dna: :computer:. If you're interested in hacking DNA and doing it with other open source developers grab my email from [_Poly_](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly)'s commit log and give me a shout or better yet check out [Poly's open issues](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly/issues) and make a pull request.
